## Psalm 9:

If a man is unhealthy let him repeat this Psalm into a new pot filled with water he has to bathe with the water after praying and he will fear no enemy again. Holy names **ELOHIM**.

SPECIAL PRAYER FOR THE PSALM

>**EHEJE AISHER** most merciful father who does promise and fulfills, may it please Thee by thy mighty holy names to deliver me from my enemy and back-biters, protect me against their treachery and malice as thou didst defend who sang this Psalm and delivered him from all his enemies Amen.
