## Psalm 2:

For danger at Sea or Storm, Whenever you travel on sea and the storm arises, and your life is in danger of death, read this Psalm without hesitation or doubt. Remember to call the holy names as you read along. Scaddei meaning God the Almighty. Begin quickly  to pray with confidence, and believe in God that is everywhere, the creator of sea without end. Thou that control the powers of the sea. Write this Psalm on a parchment of broken pot, then throw it far into the Sea from where comes the waves. You will see God's marvelous work. The waves will stop and the roaring will stop at a sudden. 

The Prayer for the Psalm:-
> Let it be thou Scaddei your will of Holy that the roaring and waves of the sea stop and let us reach our destinations safely.
Be our Guide, Thou God of Mercy, help us to be in good health, Yours is Glory and power Thou canst only be your Honorable name Selah!.
Amen.
