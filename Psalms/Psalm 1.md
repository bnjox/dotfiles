*THE USE AND EFFICACIES OF THE PSALMS*

## Psalm 1:

This Psalm is for a pregnant woman who is in fear of delivery, or a dangerous confinement, she should write or cause to be written on a piece of parchment prepared from the pure skin of a deer, the three first verses of the above Psalms, together with the hidden holy name and appropriate prayer contained herein, and place it in a small bag made expressly for that purpose and suspend it by a string about her body.

Prayer for the Psalms as follows:-
> May it please Thee, O, Eel,Chad, to grant unto this woman, N. daughter of R. that she may not at this time or at any other time, have a premature confinement; much more grant unto her a truly fortunate delivery and keep her and the fruit of her body in good Health, Amen. Selah!.
